   contain the root `toctree` directive.

ZSL - z' service layer
======================

ZSL is a Python 2.7 micro-framework utilizing
`dependency injection <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection>`_
for creating service applications on top of `Flask <https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/>`_
and `Gearman <http://gearman.org/>`_ job server.

Motivation
##########

We developed ZSL to modernize our workflow with maintaining our clients web
applications written in various older CMS solutions without the need to rewrite
them significantly. With ZSL we can write our new components in python, with one
coherent shared codebase, accessible trough Gearman or JavaScript.

Disclaimer
##########

At current stage this should be taken as proof of concept. We don't recommend to
run in any production except ours. It is too rigid, with minimum test coverage
and lots of bad code practices. We open sourced it as way of motivation for us
to make it better.
